### Dependencies
System dependencies:
- Linux OS (tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04)
- Nvidia GPU
- Nvidia driver version >= 418.39

#### Local Docker engine setup
Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) (you may want to configure your user permissions so you don't have to use sudo with every docker command -- see [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/))
```
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

Install [nvidia-container-runtime](https://github.com/nvidia/nvidia-container-runtime#docker-engine-setup) (main instructions from the link shown below)

```
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-container-runtime/gpgkey | \
  sudo apt-key add -
distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID)
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-container-runtime/$distribution/nvidia-container-runtime.list | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-runtime.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nvidia-container-runtime
```
Follow the steps for creating a drop in file to register the runtime with docker

```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/override.conf <<EOF
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd --host=fd:// --add-runtime=nvidia=/usr/bin/nvidia-container-runtime
EOF
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

## Pulling the Pre-Built Images
The image is set up with CUDA 10.1, cuDNN 7.6, and PyTorch 1.3 installed (```isaac-loco-dev```)
```
docker pull anthonysimeonov/isaac-loco-dev:latest
```


## Usage
### Running the container
Open two terminals

#### Terminal 1
In the first terminal, from within this directory (```/path/to/isaac_loco/docker/```), run the ```run_image.bash``` script to launch the container. You will enter a terminal session from within the container after launching.
```
./run_image.bash
```

#### Termainal 2
From the second terminal, run the following bash script to allow the container access to your local X server for visualization (there are better ways to do this, but we keep this relatively secure by only providing access to xhost to the specific system we want)

```
./visualize_access.bash
```

You can now run programs from within the container that are GUI-based, and have the GUI appear
on your host screen (i.e. Gazebo, RViz, PyBullet)

First, enter the container by starting a new interactive terminal session (```$CONTAINER_ID``` can usually be found by tab completing the below command, or viewing the information about the running containers by running ```docker ps```) and source the catkin workspace that has been built with the following commands
```
docker exec -it $CONTAINER_ID bash
```

## Build the Image Locally
From within this directory (```/path/to/isaac_loco/docker/```), run the following command to build the image. This will take quite a bit of time if you have not done it locally before. Please see the ```docker_build.py``` script for additional arguments that can be passed to the build command (i.e. image name, which file to use, dry run, etc.)
```
python docker_build.py
```

If you want to use a different dockerfile than the specified default, run
```
python docker_build.py -f /path/to/dockerfile.dockerfile
```

(if you are building the image locally you will need to set up your machine with public keys linked to your github account for cloning private repositories required during building)
