# Jetson Deployment Docker Image

This folder contains the Dockerfile for building the deployment docker image on the Unitree Go1 robot. 

The image is released as `episodeyang/jetson-legged-deployment:latest` on docker hub. We increase the version
number upon each build.

## Logging into Nvidia `ngc` CLI Tool

> Register an accoint, then visit: https://ngc.nvidia.com/setup/api-key 

Your API Key authenticates your use of NGC service when using NGC CLI or the Docker client. Anyone with this API Key has access to all services, actions, and resources on your behalf.

Click Generate API Key to create your own API Key. If you have forgotten or lost your API Key, you can come back to this page to create a new one at any time.

Use your API key to log in to the NGC registry by entering the following command and following the prompts:

NGC CLI
```bash
ngc config set
```

Dockerâ„¢ For the username, enter '$oauthtoken' exactly as shown. It is a special authentication token for all users.
```bash
docker login nvcr.io
> Username: $oauthtoken
> Password: dmsdfasdfadfasdfasfasfasdfasfdasdfasdf
```

API Key generated successfully. This is the only time your API Key will be displayed. Keep your API Key secret.
Do not share it or store it in a place where others can see or copy it.

### Dependencies
System dependencies:
- Linux OS (tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04)
- Nvidia GPU
- Nvidia driver version >= 418.39

#### Local Docker engine setup
Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) (you may want to configure your user permissions so you don't have to use sudo with every docker command -- see [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/))
```
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

Install [nvidia-container-runtime](https://github.com/nvidia/nvidia-container-runtime#docker-engine-setup) (main instructions from the link shown below)

```
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-container-runtime/gpgkey | \
  sudo apt-key add -
distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID)
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-container-runtime/$distribution/nvidia-container-runtime.list | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-runtime.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nvidia-container-runtime
```
Follow the steps for creating a drop in file to register the runtime with docker

```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/override.conf <<EOF
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd --host=fd:// --add-runtime=nvidia=/usr/bin/nvidia-container-runtime
EOF
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

## Pulling the Pre-Built Images
The image is set up with CUDA 10.1, cuDNN 7.6, and PyTorch 1.3 installed (```isaac-loco-dev```)
```
docker pull anthonysimeonov/isaac-loco-dev:latest
```


## Usage
### Running the container
Open two terminals

#### Terminal 1
In the first terminal, from within this directory (```/path/to/isaac_loco/docker/```), run the ```run_image.bash``` script to launch the container. You will enter a terminal session from within the container after launching.
```
./run_image.bash
```

#### Termainal 2
From the second terminal, run the following bash script to allow the container access to your local X server for visualization (there are better ways to do this, but we keep this relatively secure by only providing access to xhost to the specific system we want)

```
./visualize_access.bash
```

You can now run programs from within the container that are GUI-based, and have the GUI appear
on your host screen (i.e. Gazebo, RViz, PyBullet)

First, enter the container by starting a new interactive terminal session (```$CONTAINER_ID``` can usually be found by tab completing the below command, or viewing the information about the running containers by running ```docker ps```) and source the catkin workspace that has been built with the following commands
```
docker exec -it $CONTAINER_ID bash
```

## Build the Image Locally
From within this directory (```/path/to/isaac_loco/docker/```), run the following command to build the image. This will take quite a bit of time if you have not done it locally before. Please see the ```docker_build.py``` script for additional arguments that can be passed to the build command (i.e. image name, which file to use, dry run, etc.)
```
python docker_build.py
```

If you want to use a different dockerfile than the specified default, run
```
python docker_build.py -f /path/to/dockerfile.dockerfile
```

(if you are building the image locally you will need to set up your machine with public keys linked to your github account for cloning private repositories required during building)
